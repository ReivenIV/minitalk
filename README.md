## 💡 About the project

> _The purpose of this project is to code a small data "catarsis" program using
UNIX signals._

## 🛠️ Usage

### Requirements

The function is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Compiling**

To compile, go to the project path and run:

```shell
$ make
```

## 📋 Testing

To test the program you just need to launch the "server" and the "client" in different shell tabs with the following:

```shell
$ ./server
```

This will show your PID to make the client work and will stay waiting to receive a message from the "client"

```shell
$ ./client "PID" "Your message string"
```

By launching it, this will show "Your message string" on the server window.
---

### Mandatory

- Produce `server` & `client` executables
- `client` must communicate a string passed as a parameter to `server` *(referenced by its process ID)* which then displays it
- Use `SIGUSR1` & `SIGUSR2` signals **ONLY**

### Bonus

- Add reception acknowledgement system
- Support Unicode characters
